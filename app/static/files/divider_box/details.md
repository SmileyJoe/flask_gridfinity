These are perfect for storing small parts and long, thin objects like needle files, and you can stack them as high as you want! The inner surface has a generous scoop to make retrieving parts easy, and the tab fits 12mm label-maker tape.

I've provided a selection of different sizes and divider counts, to give you OPTIONS! Note that none of the compartment sizes overlap - there isn't a two-compartment 4x1 bin because you can just use two one-compartment 2x1 bins.

Dimensions in file names are Width x Depth x Height. Width and Depth units are 42mm grid slots, Height is in 7mm units. A Prusa i3 Mk3S can fit a five-unit-wide bin on its plate.

*Note* that two-unit-high bins don't have labels - they would cut too far into the usable storage area.

Brims and support are not required, and these can be printed in any filament with an 0.6mm or smaller nozzle. Wider bins can curl, so maximize your bed adhesion if you're going big!

## Gridfinity Tips!

- All storage blocks are compatible with all baseplates!
- Most storage blocks are stackable!
- You can add 6x2mm magnets to the corners! They won't magnetize the contents.
- You can also use M3 screws in the corners.
