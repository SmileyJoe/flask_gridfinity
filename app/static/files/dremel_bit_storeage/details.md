This is my take on Zack's Cthulhu-sized dremel bit storage model. For those that can't find it, Zacks model got taken down (I think he had to get dat $ from thangs) so Rogarat added the original model to their remix files [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4623056/files). I will include it here as well. Tesser-Wolf has a smaller (more sane) remix of Zack's model [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5269037). I remixed the latter to fit into the gridfinity system as well as to mount a stand for my flex shaft motor, and a spot for a chuck key. I'll likely add a gridfinity remix of Zack's original model in the future, but for now, this model hold about 1/2 and will likely suit the average dremel wielding debonair.

It's printing now, Ill post photos when it's finished.

I'd love to see photos of your finished prints as well as to get feedback on your experience with it. Hope you enjoy!

Edit:
It finished and it works great! I added some photos. Thanks for the downloads and I hope you all enjoy the part!
